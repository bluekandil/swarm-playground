# swarm üêùüîÑ

Imagine a swarm of bees working together‚Äîthey don‚Äôt have a single leader, but they coordinate to build a hive, find food, and protect themselves.

Swarm AI is when multiple AI ronots work together like a team‚Äîjust like a swarm of bees! Instead of one big AI making decisions, a group of small AIs communicate and collaborate to solve problems.

OpenAI's Swarm is an experimental educational framework designed to explore multi-agent systems. You can create and manage multiple AI agents that can collaborate and perform tasks seamlessly, help automate workflows across various applications.
