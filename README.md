🐝 What is Swarm AI?

Imagine a swarm of bees working together—they don’t have a single leader, but they coordinate to build a hive, find food, and protect themselves.

Swarm AI is similar! Instead of one big AI making decisions, multiple AI robots work together like a team—just like a swarm of bees! These small AIs communicate and collaborate to solve problems efficiently.

🚀 OpenAI Swarm Framework

OpenAI's Swarm is an experimental educational framework designed to explore multi-agent systems.

With Swarm, you can:✅ Create and manage multiple AI agents✅ Enable AIs to collaborate and perform tasks seamlessly✅ Automate workflows across various applications
